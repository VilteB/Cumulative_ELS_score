# This script is used for dichotomising postnatal ELS variables into 1 = risk and 0 = no risk. 

# 1. LIFE EVENTS

# In most cases, variables have been coded as:

# 1 = affected a lot
# 2 = fairly affected
# 3 = mildly affected
# 4 = not effected at all
# 5 = didn't happen
# for total number of options inlcuded need to check the dataset 

#However, how this is phrased during post-natal coding is slightly different at each time point, so we have accounted for the changes in this script
# Below script recodes them into: 

# 1 = risk (for values between 1-4)
# 0 = no risk (for value of 5)

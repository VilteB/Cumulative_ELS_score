# This script is used for dichotomising prenatal ELS variables into 1 = risk and 0 = no risk. 

# 1. LIFE EVENTS

# Originally, variables have been coded as:

      # 1 = affected a lot
      # 2 = fairly affected
      # 3 = mildly affected
      # 4 = not effected at all
      # 5 = didn't happen
      # for total number of options inlcuded need to check the dataset 

# Below script recodes them into: 

      # 1 = risk (for values between 1-4)
      # 0 = no risk (for value of 5) 
      # any other number = NA (missing)


#RECODE TO BINARY

# our R data file uses factor levels (not numeric) 
# define levels first
yes = c("affected a lot","fairly affected","mildly affected","N effect at all")
no = c("didnt happen")
